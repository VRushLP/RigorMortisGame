///statue details
all the files are the same size. this is to make layering them on top of each other very easy.
the idle animation will show before you enter, then changes into the active statue.
the active statue is actually 4 images on top of each other in this order, from first to last:
forest boss statue arm1 (despawn after 2 hits)
forest boss statue arm2 (despawn after 4 hits)
forest boss statue chest (despawn after 6 hits)
forest boss statue base (always there)

forest boss statue image sizes:
width: 673
height: 496

placement (with respect to the position the background would be placed at)
243 pixels right.
58 pixels down.
//this is just compared to my mockup image. anywhere works really, as long as it's sort of in the center.
