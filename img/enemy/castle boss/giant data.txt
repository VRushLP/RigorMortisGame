the mockup image contains some details of potential attack patterns.

there are plans for different orientations of the skull's face when it's about to attack (leaning forward to charge, grimacing before the fist slams down, etc). 

i've included the upper skull and spine to be separate images if you want to mess with those. I was thinking of a potential bite attack or even the giant puking out smaller, regular skeletons but I'm not too bothered if all the giant does is charge you and slam his fist.
